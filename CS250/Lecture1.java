// Natural numbers = positive integers (in this class it starts with 0, not 1)
// Positive naturals start with 1
// set = { ... } = collection of objects. They allow sets of sets if they are of a common type
// set building notation { n : n ia an even natural number less than or equal to 20}
// set building notation {n ∈ N : n is even and n <= 20}
//      note N is the natural number symbol
// 2 sets are equal if every element is the same as the element of another e.g. {1, 2, 3} = {1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
