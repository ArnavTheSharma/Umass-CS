// naturals are positive ints (including 0)
// predecessor of natural number is natural num before it. Successor is the one after it. 0 doesn't have a predecessor
// Natural is even if it's 2 times some natural (0 is even because 0 * 2 = 0) and odd if its x = 2*y + 1
// Least number axiom: Every natural with some property has some smallest natural number with that property

// Rocketbook notes
// Prove if x is a non-zero natural positive number that's even, that x-1 is odd
//      1) Let x be even. x = 2y by definition
//      2) If x =/= 0, x-1 exists
//      3) By def of predecessor, x-1 exists, and we can write x-1 = 2(y-1) + 1
//      4) If 0 is even because x = 0 = 2 * 0, which is 2 times some natural number
