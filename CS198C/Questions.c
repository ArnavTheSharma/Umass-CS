// When we compile src code it first converts to .obj files, and these files only have references to functions like printf. What exactly does the linker do?
// Header files vs libraries? I know the .obj code only has references to functions like printf, and the linker connects the function calls in 1 obj file to its implementation in another obj file. Does a header file like stdio.h have these implementations?

// void vs null?
