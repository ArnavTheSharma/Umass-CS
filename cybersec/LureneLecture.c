// everything is encoded in binary data, so you can 'trick' your computer to run a seperate function that it was meant to do another (e.g. when you import a library and use a method, you tell your computer (after hitting the run button) to search all these libraries and find the desired method)
// in assembly, there are no names, you needa take alot of notes and keep track of memory

// how registers work
// 

int main(int argc, char**argv) {
    char buf[256];
    strapy(buf, argv[1]) // argv[0] references program itself, which isn't what we want
}
